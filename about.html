            <p>Hi, I am Juan Manuel Pardo Lopez, a software engineer student. I am passionate about software  
                <br> development and web development and have +2 years of experience in self-web projects. <br>
                I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript and have worked on various projects that showcase
                <br> my ability to design user friendly and interactive projects.
                <br> I am a proactive individual who is always looking to improve and learn new things. I believe
                <br> in delivering high-quality work and strive to exceed the expectations of the users I deliver 
                <br> my projects.
                <br> In my free time, I enjoy taking programming courses. I am a creative person and always look
                <br> for ways to bring new ideas to the table.
                <br> Feel free to take a look at my portfolio to get a better understanding of my work and skills.
                <br> If you think I would be a good fit for your project, don't hesitate to reach out to me. 
                <br> I look forward to the opportunity to work with you.
